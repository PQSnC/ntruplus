This website is the official repository of NTRU+ that advanced to the 2nd round of the 'Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition' (www.kpqc.or.kr). NTRU+ consists of the key encapsulation mechanism NTRU+ KEM and the public key encryption NTRU+ PKE. 

We are currently updating the specification document, and the implementations may not align with the current version of the specification.
